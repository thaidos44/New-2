# 11056-project2 reflection report
During the time I spend at UC, Front-end Web Design was by far, the most unique and interesting Web Design course that I have been in, all of this was thanks to Ben and his hard work. 
As for the time I spent doing the second project, I understand the task and what needed to be done, however, I still struggles at some point, especially the SSG, which was although not my first time dealing with a framework, but by far not the easiest. 

I was given the opportunity to come up with my own design, therefore, the topic of choice at that time was one of my favourite E-sport team, T1 and their League of Legends roster. I took inspiration from their own website and used it to express in the project. Unlike project 1 which I was not given the choice to use Bootstrap, I took advantage of it this time, making the site responsive, I also wrote some scripts, which was difficult for me since this is the first time I have done it. Luckily, some of my friends who have had experiences with script were there to help me out. 

The carousel was also another issues which made my head spin for days, placing them in the right spot was challenging and making them reponsive was even harder. 

As for GitHub, I made a huge mistake for not being able to push my code daily, although I have been working through it for the past few days and constantly pressing the wrong option on my GitHub desktop which made me think I have uploaded on to the site. What made it worse is that I was crumbled with deadlines left and right, I am sure other students do feel the same as me. 

After finishing the project, I feel like there are more things that I could have spend a little more time to imporve upon, such as the developing another page for the website. On the original T1 Webite (T1.gg), when a mouse is dragged upon a clickable link or image, there is an effect which give user the idea that the link is clickable. Another thing is the navigation bar of T1 website will follow you drag the page down. 

Although I have included the img file where all of the images that I used for this project is in, I had to later on pulled them out so that link works, I do not understand how it was like that.
